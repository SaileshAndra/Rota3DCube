# Rota3DCube

a java program that achieves the rotation of a unit cube about an arbitrary fixed point. 
Produces only text output for this program. 
Output displays the desired angle of rotation, principle axis of rotation, and the arbitrary point used for rotating the unit cube.
Output also displays the vertices of the unit cube along with their co-ordinate values before and after the 3D rotation.
The program takes 5 command-line arguments for the three customizable parameters - arbitrary point A (a1, a2, a3), desired angle of rotation alpha, and the principle axis of rotation (x_axis, y_axis, or z_axis). 

In CMD/Terminal
Compile the program using - javac Rota3DCube.java
Then run it by typing - java Rota3DCube 2 2 2 45 y_axis
